# Vaccine Clinic Database
This repository contains the Vaccine Clinic Database project developed as part of a class assignment. The project was created using Microsoft Access to manage patient records, vaccine inventory, and appointment scheduling for a fictional vaccine clinic.

**Project Overview**

Through my work with Microsoft Access, I have acquired several key skills that I am confident will help me succeed in the future. This project was my first experience with RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) software, and it provided an excellent foundation in database management and analysis.

**Key Learnings**

_**1. Table Creation and Relationships**_

- Learned how to design tables for different entities and assign them appropriate fields.

- Developed an understanding of how to establish relationships between entities to ensure data integrity.



_**2. Creating Forms for Data Entry**_

- Created user-friendly forms to populate the database efficiently.

- Ensured data accuracy and consistency during the data entry process.



_**3. Data Analysis with Queries and Reports**_

- Used “Select” and “Parameter” queries to retrieve and filter data effectively.

- Designed reports to analyze and present data insights.



_**4. Switchboard Form Creation**_

- Built a switchboard form to provide easy access to all components of the database, improving user navigation and experience.
